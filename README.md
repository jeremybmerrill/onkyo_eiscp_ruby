onkyo_eiscp_ruby
================

A Ruby implementation of eISCP for controlling Onkyo receivers.

**This code is still under heavy development.**
  * Create ISCP messages and eISCP packets
  * Send/Recieve UDP eISCP messages
  * Open a TCP socket to send commands and receive solicited and non-solicited status updates.
  * Mock reciever (currently only responds to discovery)

**Inspired by https://github.com/miracle2k/onkyo-eiscp
